**Project Title**

SafeBank - A Simple and Secure Banking Smart Contract

**Simple Overview of Use/Purpose**

SafeBank is a decentralized smart contract that allows users to deposit, withdraw, and transfer funds securely on the Ethereum blockchain. It ensures safety and integrity of transactions by implementing basic checks and balances.

**Description**

SafeBank is designed to provide a simple and secure way to manage funds on the Ethereum blockchain. Users can deposit funds into the smart contract, withdraw their balance, and transfer funds to other users. The contract maintains a record of the total balance in the bank and ensures that all operations are conducted securely and efficiently. The main features include:

1. Depositing funds into the bank
2. Withdrawing funds from the bank
3. Transferring funds to another address
4. Checking individual and total balances
5. Getting Started
6. Installing

To interact with the SafeBank smart contract, you'll need:

1. An Ethereum wallet like MetaMask
2. Access to an Ethereum testnet or the mainnet
3. A development environment like Remix IDE or Truffle for deploying and interacting with the contract


**How/Where to Download Your Program**

The SafeBank contract can be copied from this repository. You can also clone the repository using Git
Any Modifications Needed to Be Made to Files/Folders
No modifications are needed to the contract itself. However, you may need to adjust the deployment scripts if you are using a specific development framework like Truffle or Hardhat.

**Executing Program**

How to Run the Program
To deploy and interact with the SafeBank contract, follow these steps:

1. Open Remix IDE: Navigate to Remix IDE in your web browser.
2. Create a New File: Create a new Solidity file (e.g., SafeBank.sol) and paste the SafeBank contract code into it.
3. Compile the Contract: Click on the "Solidity Compiler" tab and compile the contract.
4. Deploy the Contract:
Click on the "Deploy & Run Transactions" tab.
Select the appropriate environment (e.g., JavaScript VM, Injected Web3 for MetaMask).
Deploy the SafeBank contract.
5. Interact with the Contract:
Use the deployed contract's interface to call functions like deposit, withdraw, transfer, checkBalance, and checkTotalBalance.

**Step-by-Step Bullets**

1. Open Remix IDE
2. Create a new Solidity file
3. Paste the SafeBank contract code
4. Compile the contract
5. Deploy the contract
6. Interact with the contract functions


**Help**

If you encounter any issues, consider the following common problems and solutions:

1. Common Problems and Solutions
2. Compilation Errors: Ensure you are using the correct Solidity compiler version (0.8.0 or higher).
3. Deployment Issues: Check your wallet balance to ensure you have enough ETH for gas fees.
4. Function Calls Fail: Make sure you are calling the functions with the correct parameters and that your account has sufficient balance.
